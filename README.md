This project demonstrates the application of Q-Learning and Reinforcement Learning techniques in the MuJoCo physics simulator. Attempting to train Neural Networks in PyTorch using enviorment based feedback, performing complex physical tasks and motor control. The project showcases how deep Q-networks and policy gradient methods can be used to achieve sophisticated behaviors in simulated robotic environments.
